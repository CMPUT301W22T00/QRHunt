# QRHunt

Most up-to-date problem spec can be found [here](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/mod/page/view.php?id=5825439)

You are to design and implement a simple, attractive, and easy-to-use Android application to satisfy the following goals. Your design must be flexible enough to allow developers to extend or migrate it. We want a mobile application that allows us to hunt for the coolest QR codes that score the most points. Players will run around scanning QR codes, barcodes, etc. trying to find barcodes and QR codes that give them the most points. QR codes and barcodes (scannable codes) will be hashed and the hashes they produce will be analyzed and scored. A QR code that has certain properties like repeated nibbles or bytes (hex digits) will have a higher score than a QR code that does not. We have a proposed scoring system, but the implementers are free to use a different scoring system. We want users to compete with each other for the highest scoring QR codes, the most QR codes, the highest sum of QR codes, or highest scoring QR codes in a region.  When a player scans a QR code they will take a photo of what or where the QR code is and also record the geolocation of the QR code.  Players can see on a map local QR codes that other players have scanned.
